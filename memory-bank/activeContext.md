# Active Context

## Current Phase
**Phase**: Initial Implementation Complete
**Status**: Core infrastructure built and tested

## Recent Accomplishments
1. ✅ Complete project structure created
2. ✅ Core infrastructure implemented:
   - KoanValidator - Decorator-based validation with immediate feedback
   - ProgressTracker - JSON-based progress tracking with mastery calculations
   - DataGenerator - Synthetic and real dataset generation utilities
3. ✅ Project setup files created (requirements.txt, setup.py, .gitignore)
4. ✅ Comprehensive README with installation and usage instructions
5. ✅ First example notebook (01_numpy_fundamentals.ipynb) with 5 demo koans
6. ✅ Test infrastructure to verify core components

## Implementation Details

### Core Framework Architecture
The three-pillar architecture is fully functional:

1. **KoanValidator** (`koans/core/validator.py`)
   - Decorator pattern for clean validation syntax
   - Success/failure/error handling with emoji feedback
   - Automatic progress tracking integration
   - Summary statistics and reporting

2. **ProgressTracker** (`koans/core/progress.py`)
   - Persistent JSON storage in `data/progress.json`
   - Mastery level calculation per topic
   - Visual progress bars and reports
   - Notebook completion percentages

3. **DataGenerator** (`koans/core/data_gen.py`)
   - Regression, classification, clustering datasets
   - Synthetic tabular data with mixed types
   - sklearn dataset loaders (iris, wine, etc.)
   - Time series and imbalanced data support

## Next Immediate Steps

### Phase 2: Complete Level 1 Content (Weeks 3-4)
1. **Expand 01_numpy_fundamentals.ipynb** - Add remaining 5 koans:
   - Broadcasting
   - Array methods (sum, mean, std)
   - Array reshaping
   - Array stacking
   - Random arrays

2. **Create 02_pandas_essentials.ipynb** (10 koans)
   - Following same structure as notebook 01
   - Series/DataFrame operations
   - Data selection and filtering

3. **Create 03_data_exploration.ipynb** (10 koans)
   - Loading and profiling data
   - Visualization basics
   - Correlation analysis

### Phase 3: Infrastructure Enhancements
1. Add comprehensive unit tests with pytest
2. Create solution reference implementations
3. Add more helpful hints and error messages
4. Create CONTRIBUTING.md guide

## Current Focus Areas

### What's Working Well
- Clean architecture with separation of concerns
- Decorator pattern makes koans easy to write
- Progress tracking is intuitive and informative
- Test infrastructure validates core functionality

### Technical Decisions Made
1. **JSON for Progress Storage** - Simple, human-readable, git-friendly
2. **Decorator Pattern** - Clean syntax for validation
3. **Jupyter as Primary Interface** - Integrated learning environment
4. **No External Database** - Keeps setup simple
5. **Emoji Feedback** - Makes results visually clear and engaging

## Key Patterns Established

### Koan Structure (Proven Pattern)
```python
# === KOAN X: Title ===
# 🎯 Objective: Learning goal
# 📊 Difficulty: Level

"""
Concept explanation
"""

# TODO: Instructions
def my_solution():
    pass

@validator.koan(X, "Title", difficulty="Level")
def validate():
    # Assertions here
    pass

validate()
```

### Validation Response Pattern
- ✅ Green checkmark for success
- ❌ Red X for failure with helpful hints
- ⚠️  Warning triangle for errors with debug suggestions
- 🎉 Celebration emoji on success
- 💡 Light bulb for hints

## Open Questions & Considerations
1. Should we add video tutorials or just text explanations?
2. Include solution reveal button/cell in notebooks?
3. Add difficulty-based fast-track paths?
4. Create instructor dashboard for tracking multiple learners?
5. Add achievements/badges system?

## Important Notes

### For Future Development
- All notebooks should follow the established pattern
- Keep koans focused on one concept each
- Always provide conceptual explanation before exercise
- Use consistent emoji and formatting
- Test validation logic thoroughly before deployment

### For Contributors
- Core framework is stable - focus on content creation
- Follow the koan template strictly
- Write clear, encouraging validation messages
- Include variety in problem types (implementation, debugging, optimization)
- Balance difficulty progression within notebooks

### For Users
- Project is ready for early adopters to test
- Core functionality is stable
- First notebook demonstrates the system
- Full content coming in phases 2-6

## Success Metrics So Far
- ✅ Core infrastructure: 100% complete
- ✅ Project setup: 100% complete  
- ✅ Demo content: 5 koans created
- ⏳ Full content: 5/130 koans (4%)
- ⏳ Testing coverage: Basic tests only

## Blockers & Risks
None currently. Development is proceeding smoothly.

## Recent Insights
1. Decorator pattern for validation is elegant and extensible
2. JSON storage is perfect for this use case
3. Visual feedback (emojis, progress bars) enhances engagement
4. Separating core framework from content enables parallel development
5. Test script validates design decisions work in practice
