# Data Science Koans - Project Brief

## Overview
Create an educational platform for learning data science principles through hands-on exercises, inspired by Ruby Koans. The project uses Jupyter notebooks to deliver interactive koans that teach core data science concepts and practices.

## Core Objectives
1. Teach data science fundamentals through practical exercises
2. Cover essential libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn
3. Focus on key concepts: data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training/evaluation, optimization, ethics
4. Support progression from beginner to advanced levels
5. Provide automated validation and progress tracking

## Target Audience
Mixed skill levels - structured progression from beginner to advanced practitioners, assuming basic Python knowledge.

## Technical Stack
- **Platform**: Jupyter Notebooks
- **Core Libraries**: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn
- **Testing**: Custom validation framework with automated feedback
- **Progress Tracking**: Built-in system showing completion and mastery levels

## Scope
- 100-150 koans across multiple notebooks
- Organized by topic and difficulty
- Synthetic data for basics, real datasets (sklearn.datasets) for advanced topics
- Extensible architecture for future additions

## Key Features
- TODO-style exercises with automated validation
- Immediate feedback on correctness
- Progress tracking and mastery reporting
- Clear explanations and learning objectives
- Gradual complexity increase

## Success Criteria
- Clear learning path from basics to advanced concepts
- Comprehensive coverage of data science fundamentals
- Engaging, self-directed learning experience
- Easy to extend with new koans
- Robust validation and helpful error messages
