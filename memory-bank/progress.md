## Technical Decisions Log

### December 2024

**Architecture Decisions**
- ✅ Jupyter notebooks for delivery - Integrated learning environment
- ✅ Decorator-based validation - Clean, Pythonic syntax
- ✅ JSON progress storage - Simple, version-control friendly
- ✅ Three-pillar architecture - Clear separation of concerns
- ✅ No external database - Keeps setup simple

**Implementation Decisions**
- ✅ Emoji feedback - Visual clarity and engagement
- ✅ Automatic progress tracking - Seamless user experience
- ✅ Synthetic data first - Isolate concepts for learning
- ✅ Modular notebook structure - Easy to maintain and extend
- ✅ Test-driven approach - Validate design early

## Known Issues & Risks

### Current Issues
- None - core infrastructure is stable

### Potential Risks
- Content creation is time-intensive (125 koans remaining)
- Need user testing to validate learning effectiveness
- May need to adjust difficulty progression based on feedback

## Questions Resolved

### Resolved ✅
1. ✅ Target audience: Mixed levels with progressive difficulty
2. ✅ Validation approach: Jupyter cells with automated validation
3. ✅ Data strategy: Synthetic → real datasets
4. ✅ Scope: 130 koans with extensible architecture
5. ✅ Progress tracking: Built-in with mastery reporting

### Still Open ❓
1. Video tutorials vs text-only?
2. Solution reveal mechanism?
3. Difficulty-based fast tracks?
4. Instructor dashboard?
5. Achievement/badge system?

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

### Immediate (This Week)
1. Complete notebook 01 (add 5 more koans)
2. Test the complete workflow end-to-end
3. Gather initial feedback on structure

### Short Term (Next 2 Weeks)
1. Create notebooks 02 and 03
2. Write solution reference for Level 1
3. Add more comprehensive tests
4. Create CONTRIBUTING.md

### Medium Term (Next Month)
1. Complete Level 2 notebooks (04-06)
2. Complete Level 3 notebooks (07-09)
3. User testing with small group
4. Iterate based on feedback

### Long Term (Next 2-3 Months)
1. Complete Level 4 notebooks (10-13)
2. Complete Level 5 notebooks (14-15)
3. Comprehensive testing
4. Public release preparation

## Success Metrics

### Completion Metrics
- Core Infrastructure: 100% ✅
- Demo Content: 4% (5/130 koans)
- Documentation: 90% (missing CONTRIBUTING.md)
- Testing: 30% (basic tests only)

### Quality Metrics
- Code organization: Excellent
- Documentation clarity: Excellent
- User experience design: Good (needs testing)
- Extensibility: Excellent

## Notes

### What's Working Well
- Architecture is clean and maintainable
- Decorator pattern is elegant
- Progress tracking is intuitive
- Visual feedback enhances engagement
- Test infrastructure validates design

### Lessons Learned
1. Starting with solid architecture pays off
2. Test early to validate design decisions
3. Visual feedback (emojis, bars) matters
4. Separation of framework and content enables parallel work
5. Documentation should be written alongside code

### For Future Reference
- Keep koans focused on single concepts
- Balance theory and practice in explanations
- Use consistent formatting and emoji
- Test validation logic thoroughly
- Encourage without being condescending
