# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists
Learning data science requires both theoretical understanding and practical experience. Traditional tutorials often separate theory from practice, making it difficult for learners to internalize concepts. Data Science Koans bridges this gap by providing immediate, hands-on practice with concepts as they're introduced.

## Problems It Solves
1. **Passive Learning**: Reading about data science doesn't create muscle memory - doing it does
2. **Unclear Progress**: Learners often don't know what they've mastered or what to learn next
3. **Context Switching**: Jumping between documentation, tutorials, and practice environments breaks flow
4. **Confidence Gap**: Learners need validation that they truly understand concepts before moving forward
5. **Overwhelming Complexity**: Data science has many interconnected concepts that need structured introduction

## How It Should Work

### Learning Flow
1. **Discover**: Each koan presents a concept with clear explanation
2. **Practice**: Learner fills in TODO sections to implement the concept
3. **Validate**: Automated checks provide immediate feedback
4. **Progress**: System tracks completion and mastery
5. **Advance**: Natural progression to more complex topics

### User Experience Goals
- **Self-Paced**: Work at your own speed without pressure
- **Immediate Feedback**: Know right away if your solution is correct
- **Clear Direction**: Always know what to learn next
- **Achievement**: See your progress and celebrate milestones
- **Low Friction**: Everything in one place - no setup complexity

### Key Interactions
1. Open a notebook and read the introduction
2. Work through koans sequentially in the notebook
3. Fill in TODO sections based on instructions
4. Run validation cells to check correctness
5. Review feedback and iterate if needed
6. See progress update automatically
7. Move to next koan or notebook when ready

### Educational Philosophy
- **Learn by Doing**: Active engagement over passive reading
- **Progressive Complexity**: Each koan builds on previous ones
- **Conceptual Understanding**: Focus on "why" not just "how"
- **Real-World Relevance**: Use realistic scenarios and datasets
- **Encouraging Failure**: Mistakes are learning opportunities
- **Mastery-Based**: Move forward only when concepts are solid

## Target Outcomes
- Learners gain practical data science skills
- Confidence in using pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn
- Understanding of core ML concepts and best practices
- Portfolio of completed exercises demonstrating skills
- Clear path for continued learning
